Goals and Objective:

This workshop offers a general overview of virtualization technologies
with a series of practical labs, during which participants will create
and manipulate virtual machines on the desktop using VirtualBox,create
and manipulate virtual machines on the server using KVM and
libvirt,network configuation with OpenVswitch,manipulate file and block
based virtual images and work with live VM migration between
hosts,Create high availability virtualization server clusters using
LizardFS file system.Participants will also create linux containers LXC
with reliable filesystem ZFS with replication,cloning,roleback,export
and import containers. The workshop aims to provide participants with
virtualization solutions using open source software and help them to
understand the different parts of a hypervisor, including storage
management, networking, memory management, as well as linux container
technologies (lightweight virtualization)

  

Target Audience

Systems and network administrators that want to know more about
virtualization technologies in general, and learn how to build high
availability clusters.

  

Prerequisites

\# Basic knowledge of the UNIX command line and IP networking is
required.

\# It is highly recommended that participants bring their own laptop
computers with a free partition of 200GB to practice the lessons during
the workshop. Software: PuTTY,Ubuntu or Linux mint
