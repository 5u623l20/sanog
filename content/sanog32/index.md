Internet Service Providers Association of Bangladesh
([ISPAB](http://www.ispab.org)) is organising the 32nd Conference of
South Asian Network Operators Group (SANOG) from 2nd to 10th of August,
2018. SANOG32 will provide a valuable opportunity to contribute to
discussions about Internet operations, technologies and development.

  

The event will be proudly clubbed with [bdNOG9](http://www.bdnog.org/)
and will be supported by ICT Business Promotion Council
([IBPC](http://www.bpc.org.bd/ibpc_home.php)), Ministry of Commerce,
Peoples Republic of Bangladesh Government.

  

The event brings together Internet engineers and networking experts,
Government representatives, Internet business leaders, and other
interested parties from around the world to learn from training
workshops and tutorials, attend technical presentations, discuss
policies, and extend social and professional networks with like-minded
peers.

  

The venue for SANOG XXXII is selected at [Le Meridien
Dhaka](http://www.starwoodhotels.com/lemeridien/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=3810)
in the outskirt of the main part of the Capital City but around 1.2KM
from Dhaka Airport, for the convenience of communication and vibrant
surrounding. Find out the local culture where fascinating sights and
sounds abound within close proximity to the designated venue, again
which is situated prominently in the commercial district. Le Méridien
awakens your senses with stimulating experiences, inspired cuisine and
moments of discovery at every turn. Steeped in rich history yet poised
for success, the hotel is close to historic sites and exciting shopping.

  

We cordially welcome you to SANOG32 & bdNOG9 - to Bangladesh.
