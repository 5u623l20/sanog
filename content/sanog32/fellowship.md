SANOG 32 Fellowship
-------------------

  

The SANOG XXXII Fellowship program has been made possbile with a grant
from the Internet Society ([ISOC](http://www.internetsociety.org/)), and
a very active support from [APNIC](https://www.apnic.net/). The
Fellowship encourages folks from the South Asian Region to participate
in the workshop, tutorials and conference. From this year WOMEN
Applications for Fellowship will be significantly encouraged. With over
50% percent of the female population in the South Asian Region, rarely
very few of them are regulary seen to be active in the Internet area.
Thus ISOC and APNIC extended their hands to enhance women participation
in the SANOG region
