The prescheduled venue for SANOG34 was Colmbo, Sri Lanka. Due to recent
security situation in Sri Lanka, SANOG 34 will be relocated to Kolkata,
India, hosted by ISOC Kolkata during 31st July to 7th August 2019. There
is no change of dates, and the order of the event will be three days of
conference & tutorials followed by five days of workshops. Further
Details are published in this website including [venue](venue.html)
information, [hotels](accomo.html) and [travel](visa.html) information.
[Registration](reg.html) started on 20th May, 2019 and will be closed on
29th July 2019.

  

The decision was very difficult for us and our Sri Lankan Hosts, LEARN
and LKNOG. We took the decision on advise from the local host in greater
consideration of security of participants. We would like to thank LEARN
and LKNOG for continuously being in touch and guiding us during the
situation.

  

SANOG will be in Kolkata for the first time, and the Program committee
has put together a great [program](program.html). Thanks to ISOC Kolkata
chapter for stepping in to host the event, and hope to see you in SANOG
34, Kolkata.

  

We cordially welcome you to SANOG34 - to Kolkata - The Heritage of South
Asia.
