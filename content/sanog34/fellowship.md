SANOG 34 Fellowship Result
--------------------------

The SANOG XXXIV Fellowship program has been made possbile with a regular
grant from the Internet Society
([ISOC](http://www.internetsociety.org/)), and a continued active
support from [APNIC](https://www.apnic.net/). The Fellowship encourages
folks from the South Asian Region to participate in the workshop,
tutorials and conference.

  

Following the ongoing agenda of the Sponsors, WOMEN Applications for
Fellowship are being significantly encouraged. With over 50% percent of
