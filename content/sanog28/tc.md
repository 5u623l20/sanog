FIRST Technical Colloquia on Computer Security Incident Handling
----------------------------------------------------------------

  

FIRST Technical Colloquia provides a discussion forum for FIRST member
teams and invited guests to share information about vulnerabilities,
incidents, tools and all other issues that affect the operation of
incident response and security teams.

  

For you that are new in FIRST or never have attended a TC, the
colloquium typically provides one whole day of plenary sessions for
informal discussions and presentations on topics of FIRST membership
interest, or that are more sensitive in nature and related to the
day-to-day work of participants.

  

The FIRST colloquia are typically hosted by members and since 2005 are
being organized in a regional basis - the current regions being
Latin-America, North-America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. For each region
the goal is to organize one TC per year - either standing on its own, or
jointly with regional CSIRT initiatives.
