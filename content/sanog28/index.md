FIRST Technical Colloquia on Computer Security Incident Handling

[FIRST Technical Colloquia
(TCs)](https://www.first.org/events/colloquia) provide a discussion
forum for FIRST members and invited guests to share information about
vulnerabilities, incidents, tools and all other issues that affect the
operation of incident response and security teams. The TC event is open
to FIRST members and invited guests and will be held in conjunction with
SANOG 28. Sessions will be open for members and non—members of FIRST.

  

The colloquia will be a 1 day program including a plenary session and
possibly a hands-on classes. TCs are hosted and managed by a local team
or jointly with regional CSIRT. Presenters include local leading
security experts who sit down with small groups of attendees, and work
through technical topics (like forensics) in a highly interactive
hands-on fashion. Attendance ranges from 10 to 80 attendees.
