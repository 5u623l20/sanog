SANOG 35 Fellowship Result
--------------------------

The SANOG XXXV Fellowship program has been made possbile with a regular
grant from the Internet Society
([ISOC](http://www.internetsociety.org/)), and a continued active
support from [APNIC](https://www.apnic.net/). The Fellowship encourages
folks from the South Asian Region to participate in the workshop,
tutorials and conference.

  

Following the ongoing agenda of the Sponsors, WOMEN Applications for
Fellowship are being significantly encouraged. With over 50% percent of
the female population in the South Asian Region, rarely very few of them
are regulary seen to be active in the Internet area. Thus ISOC and APNIC
extended their hands to enhance women participation in the SANOG region

SANOG 35
