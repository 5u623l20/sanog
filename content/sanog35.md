The most diverse and cosmopolitan city of Pakistan, Karachi lives and
breathes with a style of its own. The most advanced city of the nation,
it often blazes forward as an example of the Pakistan to come, and
because of its diverse make­up, is sometimes described as a
mini-Pakistan, where you can find representatives of every Pakistani
culture. Karachi is the third most populous city in the world, and the
largest among the Muslim world. Because of this and its melting pot
nature, the pace of life is faster and the social attitudes more liberal
than elsewhere in the nation, and growth rate of the city makes it an
evolving hub where people from different backgrounds meet and shape the
future of the city and of Pakistan.

  

We cordially welcome you to SANOG35 - to Karachi - The economic and
cultural hub of Pakistan.
