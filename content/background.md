# Background

SANOG was started to bring together operators for educational as well as co-operation. SANOG provides a regional forum to discuss operational issues and technologies of interest to data operators in the South Asian Region.

As data networks has grown around the world, we took the initiative for a South Asian Network Operators Group (SANOG). This was in line with established practices like NANOG in North America, RIPE NCC Meetings in Europe and APRICOT in Asia. The meeting will provide a regional forum to discuss operational issues and technologies closer home for data operators in the South Asian Region. The definition includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

The first SANOG Meeting was held in Kathmandu, in January 2003, along side the CAN IT Conference 2003, which is the annual conference organized by the Computer Association of Nepal.
