# Introduction

SANOG was started to bring together operators for educational as well as co-operation. SANOG provides a regional forum to discuss operational issues and technologies of interest to data operators in the South Asian Region.

The main objective is educational, but at the same time gives vendors a chance to talk to engineers about newer technology and products on the sidelines. Engineers get to talk to each other about experiences, benefit the entire community. This non commercial people networking is in line with established practices like NANOG in North America, RIPE Meetings in Europe and APRICOT in Asia.

SANOG framework incorporates workshops and tutorials in conjunction with the meeting. While tutorials will always be part of any SANOG meeting, workshops are done when there is a demand and resources are available. The regional area covered by SANOG includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri-Lanka. We also welcome participants from West Asia to the gathering to build up relationships. While issues in this region will be discussed prominently, participants from the Internet policy and operational community all over the world are welcome.

SANOG specially invites people from the community to contribute through being instructors and sharing experience. Network operators in the region are in nascent stage of development, and all such help will be valuable. We also welcome participants from all regions who can benefit by SANOG's educational goals.

SANOG has MoUs with Asia Pacific Internet Association (APIA) and APNIC, the Regional Internet Registry for Asia Pacific region to exchange experiences, help each other in achieving the objectives, and to support and enhance each others' works. SANOG will also see representation from other RIRs specially the RIPE NCC to enhance West Asia's participation in the meeting.
